This project implements a stock price prediction and automated trading system using machine learning techniques. 
It uses historical stock data to train a model, predicts future prices, and simulates automated buy/sell transactions. 
The system also allows users to set stop-loss and target-profit thresholds and visualizes the performance of the model against real stock data.

To run the application:
Run Main.py
Follow the prompts:

  Enter end date (YYYY-MM-DD): 
  Enter stop loss percentage (e.g., 0.02 for 2%): 
  Enter target profit percentage (e.g., 0.05 for 5%):
